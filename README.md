# pyIntegrate
A simple app to calculate definite integrals.

## How to Run
Python 2.7+ is required to run this app. Open a command prompt and type in the
following command,

    $ python integrate.py

## Giving Inputs
Any function of x can be given as an input function. E.g. x+3, sin(x), log(x^2) etc.

Lower and Upper limit can be any floating point value.

Steps should be an integer between 1 and 10000.

## How it works
Trapezoidal method is used to compute the value of the definite integral.

## Why this App ?
This is the first application that introduced me to the world of python and numerical methods 7 years ago.
